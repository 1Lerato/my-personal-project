          event planning, florist and event equipment rental services.
          <br />

          We aim to cater to the clients in and around Johannesburg from anyone
          wanting to throw a birthday party, bridal shower, wanting to give
          their loved ones a beautiful send off or baby showers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our planning service entails the detailed planning and preparation of
          events from ideas or concepts to realisation with a basic check list
          for all types of events mentioned above. We provide for everything a
          client may need from formal/casual dinner setup to flower
          arrangements, tables, chairs etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          Florist services entails making client specific bouquets, event
          centred flower arrangements and basic everyday florist flowers sold to
          the Westrand community and online to be delivered across Johannesburg.
          <br />

          Rental services entail the rental of tables, chairs, tents, gas
          stoves, tents, heaters, fans, cutlery, glassware and dinnerware to
          community members at a set price per item, if clients donâ€™t want to
          make use of our planning services. This will be offered to clients in
          and around Johannesburg, delivered and collected by us. This will be
          for events not planned by us for example, funerals, weddings, baby
          showers or even birthday parties.
